 	<h2>I love travelling</h2>
 	<p>Travelling has always had a lot of importance in my life. When I was younger, I used to live abroad (I lived in Oman and in Australia). These experiences were amazing and I had the opportunity to go on a lot of different trip. Unfortunately, I travel less now but there are a lot of destinations that I am looking forward to discovering</p>

 	<h2>I am passionate about art</h2>
 	<p>I have always been sensitive to all forms of visual arts such as paintings, drawings, drama or sculpture. This is why it is always a great pleasure for me to go to museums or to the theatre. However, what I love to practice the most is drawing, as it brings out a lot of emotions in me.</p>

 	<h2>Sport</h2>
 	<p>Doing sports is a way for me to evacuate any kind of stress or pressure. I prefer doing sports individually without any exterior contact to be in my own bubble. I therefore go to the gym 4 times a week. </p>
